# Project Details
Write the Rectangle.java. The Rectangle class defines a rectangle by holding width and height and has two methods to calculate the area of the rectangle and the length of its diagonal.
Develop a RectangleTest.java test code. Test code should create rectangles with various widths and heights, then verify if the calculated area and diagonal match the expected values.

# Run tests
```bash
mvn test
